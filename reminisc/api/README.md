- **Headers**:
  - `openai_api_key` (string): The OpenAI API key for classifying the input.
- **Response**:
  - `should_store_memory` (boolean): Indicates whether the input should be stored as a memory.
- **Description**: Classifies the user input to determine if it should be stored as a memory for the specified user.

### Process User Input

- **URL**: `/process`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body** (`MemoryQuery`):
  - `query` (string): The user input to be processed.
  - `user_id` (string): The ID of the user associated with the input.
- **Headers**:
